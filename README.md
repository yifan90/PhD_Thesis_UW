# PhD_Thesis_UW
 
 PhD thesis and the MATLAB code used for its numerical calculation.
 
 The code is used for the second part of the thesis that study the singularities (boundary of the region of interests (ROI)) using microlocal analysis.
 
 Code not well organized, just upload to here for the record and has been rewritten in Python (https://github.com/yifan90/pet_singularity_analysis).
 
 Part of the code is modified from the code written by François Monard (https://people.ucsc.edu/~fmonard/)
